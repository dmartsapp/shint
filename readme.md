This is a telnet client that connects to arbitrary URLs and names with ports 
and downloads contents and headers from URLs. 

The purpose of this client is a single client that does telnet for:
- port alive checks for both UDP and TCP
- Download http/https URLs and report site response (no authentication)
- DNS resolution report for all URLs or addresses given


This is not a replacement for actual telnet client that comes with most operating systems.
This is a hobby application that solves specific problem of:
- Telnet client availability on machines that doesn't come installed with it and you dont have admin privilege to install this client
- Some specific need, such as report time taken to reach an address or site responsiveness and also 
- bandwidth taken to download the content

# Repeating, THIS IS NOT REPLACEMENT FOR THE ACTUAL TELNET CLIENT
