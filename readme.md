### This is a telnet client that connects to arbitrary URLs and names to their ports and downloads contents and headers from URLs. 

>[!NOTE]
> The purpose of this client is a single client that does telnet for:
> - port alive checks for both UDP and TCP
> - Download http/https URLs and report site response (no authentication)
> - DNS resolution report for all URLs or addresses given

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This is not a replacement for actual telnet client that comes with most operating systems.
> This is a hobby application that solves specific problem of:
> - Telnet client availability on machines that doesn't come installed with it and you dont have admin privilege to install this client
> - Some specific need, such as report time taken to reach an address or site responsiveness and also 
> - bandwidth taken to download the content
